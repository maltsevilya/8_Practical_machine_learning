## Вопрос
If K is small in a K-fold cross validation is the bias in the estimate of out-of-sample (test set) accuracy smaller or bigger? If K is small is the variance in the estimate of out-of-sample (test set) accuracy smaller or bigger. Is K large or small in leave one out cross validation?

    1. The bias is larger and the variance is smaller. Under leave one out cross validation K is equal to two.
    2. The bias is larger and the variance is smaller. Under leave one out cross validation K is equal to the sample size.
    3. The bias is smaller and the variance is smaller. Under leave one out cross validation K is equal to one.
    4. The bias is smaller and the variance is bigger. Under leave one out cross validation K is equal to one.
